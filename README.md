### 💬 whoami

I'm Bhavya — a curious human navigating the chaotic beauty of tech, currently interning as an SDE and building some wild AI x backend stuff. Think voice cloning, LLM pipelines, cron jobs that actually work, and late-night debugging sessions powered by iced coffee.

> I vibe at the intersection of **applied AI**, **scalable backend systems**, and **telling stories that matter**.

### 🛠 What I'm Building / Exploring

- 🧩 Architecting multilingual AI video dubbing pipelines using Whisper, XTTS, Celery, FFmpeg, and all that jazz  
- ⚙️ Playing with infra tools like Redis, Docker, gRPC, Celery, and LangChain  
- 🧠 Digging into LLM agents, model communication protocols (MCP), and vector databases  
- 🤖 Building backend microservices in Django & FastAPI (Python supremacy)  
- 📚 Writing about tech, growth, and everything in between  
- ✨ Learning, unlearning, and relearning... repeat
